			<h2>The Beginning</h2>
		</header>
		<p>On March 12th, 2022, the first ever whitelisted session was hosted, and was announced publically in the announcements channel in the main CRPC Discord server. This was oringinally done 
		as a census to see how many users would like a whitelisted server, and after that, the whitelisted continued on.</p>

					<h3>The Evolution</h3>
				</header>
				<p>As time went on, the support for the whitelisted continued to grow, and they were eventually given a dedicated Discord and Roblox group to 
				continue with sessions. Eventually, the whitelisted was given early access to the private server system, via a chat command.</p>

					<h3>The Continued Growth</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The whitelisted prospered all throughout 2023, showing no signs of slowing down, and was the first Maple County private server to reach over three thousand 
				Discord members. When the private server system released, there was competition, and unfortunately, then came the inevitable downfall.</p>

					<h3>The Downfall</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Due to numerous factors, the whitelisted fell into a state of inactivity, and remained that way for some time. Attempts 
				were made to repair the server, and they worked briefly, but nobody was ever able to keep it active for a long period of time.</p>

			<h2>The Whitelisted Today</h2>
		</header>
		<p>The whitelisted was in a state of disarray until the current Board of Directors stepped in to completely overhaul the server, and
		it worked. Now, with everything that is different about the whitelisted, it has been active for months and continues to grow as it once was.</p>
