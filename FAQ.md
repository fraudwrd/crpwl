<h2 id="content">What is the whitelisted?</h2>
<p>The CRPC Official Whitelisted server is a strict no-nonsense roleplay server that operates in a private server inside of the Roblox experience 'Maple County'. We are the
only officially endorsed private server within the Central Roleplay Community. If this is your first time hearing about us, and might be interested in what we do, feel free to 
join using the Discord server invite code discord.gg/crpwl

The rest of this page will be dedicated to answering key questions for new and returning players.</p>

		<h3>How do I get whitelisted?</h3>
		<p>We, under new management, have decided to deprecate the whitelist process for the official roleplay server. However, we still maintain this 
		whitelisted aspect for all emergency service departments. Now, you must be in our Discord, Roblox group, and Sonoran CAD server in order to participate in 
		roleplay sessions. The Roblox group and Sonoran CAD information can be found in our Discord.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Can I be a moderator or VIP?</h3>
		<p>Moderators are either handpicked out of prominent members of the community or through applications that we will announce in our Discord server. VIP's are special individuals that 
		have contributed to the server or community in a way that has positively impacted a large amount of people.</p>

	<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Do I need Voice Chat?</h3>
		<p>Yes and no. Under new management, we have decided to drop the voice chat required policy for CIVILIANS. Emergency service personnel are still required to use voice chat when 
		interacting with others. Civilians however, can join a scene voice channel and respond via Roblox chat or the #roleplay-chat channel in our Discord. Roblox voice 
		chat is not permitted.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>How do I join an emergency service department?</h3>
		<p>To join an emergency service department, you must join the Roblox group, then update your roles in our Discord server. From there, navigate to the #departments 
		channel where you can select what department you would like to apply to. When you select a department, Appy will DM you to proceed with the application.</p>

		<h3>Help! My question wasn't listed here!</h3>
